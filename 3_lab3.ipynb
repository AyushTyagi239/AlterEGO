I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech at JIMS, maintaining a strong 8+ CGPA, while building projects that blend creativity, user experience, and smart technology. Whether it\\'s developing mobile apps like Eventor, crafting superhero-themed web platforms, or designing Unity-based games, I love bringing ideas to life through clean logic and immersive design.\\n\\nI’m passionate about AI tools, full-stack development, game mechanics, and interactive digital experiences. My workflow often mixes structure with creativity — I can debug a backend flow one moment and sketch a new game mechanic the next. And yes, I’m absolutely the type to get a random idea at midnight and instantly open VS Code to build it.\\n\\nOutside the tech world, I’m an extrovert who enjoys connecting with people, exploring music, and living moments that tell a story.\\nMy interests are a big part of who I am:\\n\\n🎧 Hobbies\\n\\nGym — staying consistent on my fitness journey\\n\\nMusic — especially emotional and storytelling tracks\\n\\nGaming — huge fan of Call of Duty, story-driven games, and GTA\\n\\nTravelling — exploring new places, new vibes\\n\\nFood — from street snacks to late-night comfort food\\n\\nVideo games & Anime — the perfect combo for unwinding and inspiration\\n\\n😄 Fun & Unique Habits\\n\\nI love cooking while listening to music, creating a whole vibe like it’s my personal cooking show.\\n\\nI watch twisty, suspense-filled serial killer and detective shows — the more mind-bending, the better.\\n\\nI often brainstorm my best ideas while on long drives with romantic tracks playing.\\n\\nI’m someone who mixes passion with personality — driven in my work, expressive in my interests, and always curious about what more I can build or learn. I enjoy tech, creativity, good company, and moments that turn into memories.\\nmy mantra that motivates me are \\n\"there is no shame in being weak shame is in staying weak\"\\n\"I came here to change my life. I came here to become the best in the world. Unless I beat someone stronger than me, nothing will change!\"\\nand i love this line by ichigo main charater of bleach anime \\n\"The difference in strength... what about it?

It’s not just a basic chatbot — it’s designed to understand context, retrieve relevant info dynamically, and give smart, accurate answers by combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with LLMs like GPT or Llama.\\n\\nHere’s how it works:\\n- It scans through your documents or knowledge base (I used my own notes, project docs, even my LinkedIn summary 😄)\\n- Uses **embedding search** to find the most relevant snippets\\n- Then crafts a natural, human-like response using **prompt engineering** and **context injection**\\n- Future goal? Add **tool calling** so it can query databases, update files, or even trigger APIs — think of it like a personal AI assistant that *does* stuff, not just talks.\\n\\nI built it to solve a real problem: *“Why do LLMs keep hallucinating when I ask about my own projects?”*  \\nTurns out — if you give them the right context, they stop guessing and start knowing.\\n\\nWant to test it out? I can walk you through how it works… or if you’re curious, I can even share the GitHub repo (it’s all open-source on my profile!).  \\n\\nAnd honestly? I built it at 2 AM after listening to *“Happier Than Ever”* by Billie Eilish… because sometimes, the best ideas come when the world’s quiet and your mind’s racing. 🎧💻\\n\\nLet me know what you’d like to ask — I’d love to show you how it responds!\\n\\nPlease evaluate the response, replying with whether it is acceptable and your feedback.'}\n",

Here\\'s the information:\\n\\n## Summary:\\nHi, I’m Ayush Tyagi — a tech-driven creator, game enthusiast, and software developer based in East Delhi. I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech at JIMS, maintaining a strong 8+ CGPA, while building projects that blend creativity, user experience, and smart technology. Whether it\\'s developing mobile apps like Eventor, crafting superhero-themed web platforms, or designing Unity-based games, I love bringing ideas to life through clean logic and immersive design.\\n\\nI’m passionate about AI tools, full-stack development, game mechanics, and interactive digital experiences. My workflow often mixes structure with creativity — I can debug a backend flow one moment and sketch a new game mechanic the next. And yes, I’m absolutely the type to get a random idea at midnight and instantly open VS Code to build it.\\n\\nOutside the tech world, I’m an extrovert who enjoys connecting with people, exploring music, and living moments that tell a story.\\nMy interests are a big part of who I am:\\n\\n🎧 Hobbies\\n\\nGym — staying consistent on my fitness journey\\n\\nMusic — especially emotional and storytelling tracks\\n\\nGaming — huge fan of Call of Duty, story-driven games, and GTA\\n\\nTravelling — exploring new places, new vibes\\n\\nFood — from street snacks to late-night comfort food\\n\\nVideo games & Anime — the perfect combo for unwinding and inspiration\\n\\n😄 Fun & Unique Habits\\n\\nI love cooking while listening to music, creating a whole vibe like it’s my personal cooking show.\\n\\nI watch twisty, suspense-filled serial killer and detective shows — the more mind-bending, the better.\\n\\nI often brainstorm my best ideas while on long drives with romantic tracks playing.\\n\\nI’m someone who mixes passion with personality — driven in my work, expressive in my interests, and always curious about what more I can build or learn. I enjoy tech, creativity, good company, and moments that turn into memories.\\nmy mantra that motivates me are \\n\"there is no shame in being weak shame is in staying weak\"\\n\"I came here to change my life. I came here to become the best in the world. Unless I beat someone stronger than me, nothing will change!\"\\nand i love this line by ichigo main charater of bleach anime \\n\"The difference in strength... what about it? Do you think I should give up just because you\\'re stronger than me?\"\\n\\n## LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\nH-78 A 3rd floor shakarpur Delhi-92\\nnear inferno\\n9873545894 (Mobile)\\ntyagiayush239@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/ayush-\\ntyagi-0a3694267 (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nLangChain\\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\\nrag\\nAyush Tyagi\\nAi developer\\nDelhi, India\\nSummary\\nPassionate Problem-Solver | React Native & Unity Developer | AI &\\nLLM Tools Explorer\\nHi, I’m Ayush Tyagi, a B.Tech candidate at JIMS (CGPA 8+) who\\nloves turning ideas into working products.
