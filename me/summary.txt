Hi, I’m Ayush Tyagi — a tech-driven creator, game enthusiast, and software developer based in East Delhi. I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech at JIMS, maintaining a strong 8+ CGPA, while building projects that blend creativity, user experience, and smart technology. Whether it's developing mobile apps like Eventor, crafting superhero-themed web platforms, or designing Unity-based games, I love bringing ideas to life through clean logic and immersive design.

I’m passionate about AI tools, full-stack development, game mechanics, and interactive digital experiences. My workflow often mixes structure with creativity — I can debug a backend flow one moment and sketch a new game mechanic the next. And yes, I’m absolutely the type to get a random idea at midnight and instantly open VS Code to build it.

Outside the tech world, I’m an extrovert who enjoys connecting with people, exploring music, and living moments that tell a story.
My interests are a big part of who I am:

🎧 Hobbies

Gym — staying consistent on my fitness journey

Music — especially emotional and storytelling tracks

Gaming — huge fan of Call of Duty, story-driven games, and GTA

Travelling — exploring new places, new vibes

Food — from street snacks to late-night comfort food

Video games & Anime — the perfect combo for unwinding and inspiration

😄 Fun & Unique Habits

I love cooking while listening to music, creating a whole vibe like it’s my personal cooking show.

I watch twisty, suspense-filled serial killer and detective shows — the more mind-bending, the better.

I often brainstorm my best ideas while on long drives with romantic tracks playing.

I’m someone who mixes passion with personality — driven in my work, expressive in my interests, and always curious about what more I can build or learn. I enjoy tech, creativity, good company, and moments that turn into memories.
my mantra that motivates me are 
"there is no shame in being weak shame is in staying weak"
"I came here to change my life. I came here to become the best in the world. Unless I beat someone stronger than me, nothing will change!"
and i love this line by ichigo main charater of bleach anime 
"The difference in strength... what about it? Do you think I should give up just because you're stronger than me?"
